# Banker-s-algorithm
Applying Banker's algorithm with a simple GUI
first you will see the greeting page which is the entry page.html
it was designed to take the number of resources from the user but time didnot help hopfully will be updated afterward.
then you will be redirected to the the firstpage.html which takes the inputs from the user.
note: you must hit the apply button for each table to save the numbers you entered in a 2d-array before hitting the check button. 
you will get an alert message by the result if it was safe it will provide the safe sequence if not it will inform you.

nothing to say more..it is a simple webpage nothing needed to run the code except a browser!!
